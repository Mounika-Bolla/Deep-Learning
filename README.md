## Student Information
- **Name:** [Mounika Bolla]  
- **Student ID:** 700757766  
- **Course:** [CS 5720]  


## Project Overview
This assignment focuses on implementing and analyzing a deep model using Google Colab. The project involves training a model and evaluating its performance using accuracy and loss curves.

## Code Explanation
The assignment includes:
1. **Data Preprocessing** - Loading and preparing the dataset.
2. **Model Training** - Training the model using an appropriate number of epochs.
3. **Performance Evaluation** - Observing accuracy/loss curves for insights.
4. **Overfitting Analysis** - Identifying overfitting using divergence in accuracy/loss curves.
5. **Final Observations** - Noting diminishing returns and plateauing behavior.

## How to Run the Code
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook in **Google Colab**.
2. Run the code cells sequentially.
3. Observe the training and validation metrics.
4. Analyze the output and graphs.

## Results & Observations
- **Initial Training**: Both accuracy and loss curves improve rapidly within the first few epochs.
- **Diminishing Returns**: The rate of improvement slows down after 5-10 epochs.
- **Overfitting Signs**: Training accuracy keeps increasing while validation accuracy plateaus or declines.
- **Resource Utilization**: Running too many epochs leads to unnecessary computation without significant improvement.

## Submission Instructions
1. The source code has been uploaded to this GitHub repository.
2. A video demonstration (2-3 minutes) explaining the code and results has been recorded and submitted.
3. This README file provides an overview and explanation of the assignment.
